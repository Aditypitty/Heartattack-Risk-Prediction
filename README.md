❤️ Heart Attack Risk Prediction
📌 Project Overview

The Heart Attack Risk Prediction project is a machine learning–based system that predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical and lifestyle parameters. Using supervised learning techniques, the model analyzes key health indicators such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate to identify patterns associated with cardiovascular risk.

🎯 Objectives

Build a predictive model to estimate the probability of a heart attack.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify major risk factors.

Apply and compare multiple machine learning algorithms for accuracy.

Provide a data-driven approach for preventive healthcare analysis.

🧠 Key Features

Data preprocessing, feature selection, and normalization.

Model training using Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Trees.

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Visualization of correlations, distributions, and prediction insights.
